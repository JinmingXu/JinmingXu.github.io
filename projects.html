<h2>Distributed Optimization for Large-Scale Data Processing</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>This project aims to develop distributed algorithms for large-scale statistical signal processing and machine learning problems. Most existing distributed algorithms usually require a perfect synchronization mechanism and decaying stepsize for achieving the exact optimum, restricting it from being asynchronously implemented and resulting in slower convergence rates. In addition, the assumption of the boundedness of (sub)gradient is often made for convergence analysis, which is quite restrictive in unconstrained problems. To overcome these issues, in this project, we developed two novel distributed algorithms both of which involve an extra step of consensus in each iteration and can be thus regarded as augmented versions of existing conterparts. Both algorithms, namely <i>Distributed Forward-Backward Bregman Splitting</i> (D-FBBS) and <i>Augmented Distributed Gradient Method</i> (AugDGM), are able to converge to the exact optimum even with constant stepsize over stochastic (even asynchronous) networks without the assumption of boundedness of (sub)gradient and achieves the best known convergence rates in the existing literature.</p>

<h2>Distributed Optimization for Networked Dynamic Systems</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>This project aims to develop distributed control schemes for large-scale networked dynamic systems. In this project, we proposed a novel distributed simultaneous perturbation approach (D-SPA) to achieve coordinated control of systems based on simultaneous perturbation techniques as well as con-
sensus strategies. The proposed method is model-free and requires little knowledge on the coupling structure of the problem to be optimized. Using singular perturbation and averaging theory, we show that the proposed scheme is able to converge to the neighborhood of the Pareto optimum of the problem so long as the energy of perturbation signals is sufficiently small. To illustrate its effectiveness, we applied the proposed approach to asimulated offshore wind farm for energy maximization and make a comprehensive comparison with the existing state-of-the-art technique. We also extended this approach to account for (unknown) constraints imposed on the system, yielding a distributed primal-dual simultaneous perturbation approach.</p>
